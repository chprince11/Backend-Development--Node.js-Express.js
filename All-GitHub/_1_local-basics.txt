** Version control using Git **
- Version control: 
- git: 
  
- The folder where we works is known as "Working directory"

* git init ( initialize the git into the working directory )

- In order to start tracking the changes of the file, for example test.txt then I need to add this file to what called a "Staging Area"

* git status ( to see what is going on )

- untracked files always be in red color
- To add into the staging area we need to use the command

* git add fileName.txt
- Now, it is added into the staging area and in green color
- Now time to commit the change

* git commit -m "Initial commit"
- -m ( for the message, helps us to understand what the change is about )

- Also check the commit made
* git log ( show the date & time of the commit, who made the commit, and a hash value for the commit made )

* git add . ( add everthing which is there in the working directory )

-
* git diff file.txt 
- ( show the changes made from what is was before ) 

* git checkout file.txt 
- ( it will revert the changes made and put the last verison of that file )

** RECAPE **

* git init ( to initialize the git )
* git status ( to see what is going on )
* git add fileName.txt ( Staged area )
* git commit -m "Initial commit"
* git add . ( add everthing )
* git log ( information commit made )
* git diff file.txt ( show change difference)
* git checkout file.txt ( to last version commited)
