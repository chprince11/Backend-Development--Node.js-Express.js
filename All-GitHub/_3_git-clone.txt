** Git clone **

- First, you need to locate the repository you want to clone.

-This is usually done by obtaining the URL of the repository from a hosting service like GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket, etc.

Run the Command: Once you have the URL, you run the git clone command followed by the URL. For example:

- git clone <repository_URL>

- Git will create a new directory on your local machine with the same name as the repository and it will copy all the files and directories into this new directory.

-Once the cloning process is complete, you'll have a fully functional local copy of the repository on your machine. 

-You can now work on the files, make changes, commit those changes, and push them back to the remote repository if you have the necessary permissions.
