** If the OS is a Pistachio: ** 
- Shell the outer layer of the kernel
- Kernel is the actual nut inside

- In computing the Kernel refers to the actual program that interfaces with the hardware. So it's the core of your OS.

- The shell in computing refers to the user interface for you as a human to be able to interact with the kernal and in turn with the hardware of your computer. 

-GUI ( Graphical User Interface ) eg: Windows Explorer, Mac Finder, 

-CLI ( Command Line Interface )  

- We are going to start with the BASH shell stands for ( Bourne Again Shell ).
- Bash shell is a CLI or a Commmand line interpreter for the Unix system.
- And we can find Unix-based system or Unix-like systems all over the place.
- ex: Linux is Unix-like system and Mac OS runs on a Unix-like OS. 

Ques: Why to use CLI ?
- It has greater control and speed. Full control on the hidden files too.
- ex: mkdir Music this command basically create a folder name Music. It's too fast.  
- ls -a ( will list all the files )
